# CS 5103 Software Engineering Course Project - README
## Project by Daniel Tellez

1. ### **Purpose:**
    The goal of this project is to go through all software engineering practices by creating a small personal project.  As I develop my given project, I will be implementing various software engineering practices such as creating textual-based specifications to better understand requirements engineering, testing, designing, using a version control system, applying different tool applications, and much more.

2. ### **Project Topic:**
    The project topic I have chosen for my personal project will be **String and Words**.<br></br>
    The goal for **String and Words** is to create a simple application that will
    `perform various word statistics of a given document (as a string)`.  This includes, but may not be limited to, counting the `frequency of each unique word` and supporting `combinations of space, tab, and newline characters as seperators`.

3. ### **Project Implementation:**
    I will implement **String and Words** using Python 3.  This includes creating the source code and test files in Python.<br><br>
    I will also utilize GitHub as my Version Control System (VCS) to keep track of all my changes using separate branches.

4. ### **Project Process and Documentation:**
    - GitHub will be used for keeping track of my code and changes related to it.
        - Unit tests/files will also be tracked here.
    - A separate document for specifications (requirements engineering) will be created.  This document will contain the textual-based specifications as well as test cases.
